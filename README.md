# Earthquake_BMKG
This repository contains a Python-based earthquake detection system that utilizes data from the Indonesian Agency for Meteorology, Climatology, and Geophysics (BMKG). BMKG is responsible for monitoring and reporting on earthquakes in Indonesia. This system processes the data provided by BMKG to detect earthquakes in real-time and provide alerts to users. The goal of this project is to improve earthquake preparedness and response in Indonesia by providing timely and accurate information about seismic activity. We welcome contributions from the community to help improve this system and make it more effective. Letâ€™s work together to make Indonesia safer from earthquakes!
